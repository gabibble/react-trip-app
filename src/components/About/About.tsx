          This project was built as my Coding Temple Capstone project. It was an
          opportunity to combine my love of travel, geography, design, data, and
          of course, coding. I hope you find it useful and fun to use! The data
          is based on estimates and should only be used as a starting point for
          travel plans, not as a reliable source of cost information. See where
          the data is coming from below. Iâ€™d love to continue to update this
          project with more accurate and specific data. If you have any ideas
          about how to improve this application, let me know!
