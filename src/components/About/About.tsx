          with a PostgreSQL database. Front-end built in React. This project was
          an opportunity to combine my love of travel, geography, design, data,
          and of course, coding. I hope you find it useful and fun to use! The
          data is based on estimates and should only be used as a starting point
          for travel plans. See where the data is coming from below. Iâ€™d love to
          continue to update this project with more accurate and specific data.
